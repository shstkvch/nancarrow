# First attempt at defining a language to play two loops simultaneously, as polyrhythms:

phrase 1
    B A C D E

section 1
    set the tempo to 140bpm
    play phrase 1

section 2
    tempo = 100
    play phrase1
    play phrase2

play section 1 and section 2 together

# Second attempt at defining a language

Play the notes B, A, C endlessly. Call this loop 1.

Play the notes E, F, G, A endlessly. Call this loop 2.

Play loop 1 and loop 2 together. 

# Third attempt

section one goes like this: 

phrase1 goes A, D, C
phrase2 goes G, A

play phrase1 on the piano badly
play phrase2 on the flute badly

# full example 
phrase1 goes A, D, C
phrase2 goes G, A

play phrase1 on the piano badly
play phrase2 on the flute perfectly
